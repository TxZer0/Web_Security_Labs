# Web_Security_Labs

## Introduction
   This project contains hands-on labs related to web application security vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability is organized into a separate folder with a clear and easy-to-use structure. Each folder includes a docker-compose.yml file for easy environment setup.

##  Requirements
   Docker

## Installation Instructions
1. Move to the type of vulnerable you want to work on
```bash
   cd type_of_vulnerable
```

2. Start the environment
```bash
   docker-compose up --build
```

3. Each lab uses a specific port (defined in the docker-compose.yml file). Check the port in the file and access the application via the following URL:
```bash
   http://localhost:<port>
```

### Note:
  Solutions for the lab are provided in the exploit.md file
  
  This project is for educational purpose.
